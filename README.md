# Data Structure and Algorithms in Java
# Author: Richard Zhou

#### This is the collection of my personal implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java inspired by UC Berkeley CS 61B.

# Table of Contents
* ###*Proj0: NBody*
    * This program simulates the the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation.
    * Takes user's input on command line then draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with 
    the power of gravity.
* ### _Proj1A: Data Structures_ 
    * This project implements two common data structures APIs:
        * Linked List Deque
            * Doubly linked list built on naive linked list
            * Utilizes sentinel node to avoid NullPointerException while 
            supports traversal in two directions
            * Supports adding, removing, getting from index and printing in two directions
        * Array List Deque
            * Built on Java array that supports traversal in two directions
            * Supports adding, removing, getting from index and printing
            * Automatically truncates array size to save memory when usage ratio is low
